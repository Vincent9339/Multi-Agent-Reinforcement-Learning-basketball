# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in a Custom Environment

This repository contains an implementation of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in a custom-built environment. The environment is designed from scratch using only numpy, ensuring efficiency and flexibility for various MARL experiments. Additionally, the project features a custom visualization tool created with shapely and "matplotlib" to effectively illustrate the agents' interactions and environment dynamics.

## Features:

- **Custom Environment**: Built entirely using **numpy**, providing a lightweight and easily modifiable environment.
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Capable of handling multiple agents with complex interactions.
- **Custom Visualization**: Visualize the environment and agent behaviors using **shapely** and **matplotlib[scatter plot]** for clear and insightful representations.

## Visualization

The environment visualization will be rendered automatically, showing real-time interactions between the agents. Option to visualize the interaction in 3 different mode:

1. Random
2. Model
3. Log
